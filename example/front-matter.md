# Front-matter values

The SSG supports three basic configurations:
- `title` which is used as menu item caption
- `weight` which is used as menu item weight, the higher the value, the higher on the menu the page will be shown
- `author` this is just another config value, that allows the exposure of the author to the template in a structured way
